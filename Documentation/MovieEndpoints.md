# Movies endpoints

These are endpoints defined in `MovieController.java`. They are used to interact with the Movies API.

## `Movie` Model

A `Movie` object has the following fields:

- **Long** _id_: The `id` address of the movie. It is autogenerated and is read-only.

- **String** _name_: The title of the movie. Can be updated.

- **Int** _releaseYear_: The year when the movie was released. Can be updated.

- **`List<Wishlist>`** _wishlists_: The [wishlists](/Documentation/WishlistEndpoints.md#wishlist-model) that this movie is contained within. (Many-to-many)

## Endpoints

### **GET** `/movies` (`List<Movie>`)

Get all movies as a list of [`Movie`](#movie-model) Objects.

### **GET** `/movies/{id}` (`Movie`)

Get a movie by `id` (`Long`). If a movie with the given id doesn't exist, a "Status 204: No Content" response will be returned instead.

### **POST** `/movies` (`Movie`)

Create a movie.

In order to create a movie, you also need to pass a JSON request body containing the following fields:

```ts
type RequestBody = {
  name: String;
  releaseYear: Int;
};
```

### **PUT** `/movies/{id}` (`Movie`)

Update a movie.

You also need to pass a JSON request body containing the following fields:

```ts
type RequestBody = {
  name?: String;
  releaseYear?: Int;
};
```

### **DELETE** `/movies` (`List<Movie>`)

Delete all movies. The list of movies that are deleted are returned as the response.

### **DELETE** `/movies/{id}` (`Movie`)

Delete a movie by `id`. The movie that is deleted is returned as the response.

If no movie with the given `id` exists, then a Status 204: No Content response is returned instead.
